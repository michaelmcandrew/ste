The file:

modules/civicrm/drupal/modules/views/civicrm.views.inc

... has been amended to roll-back changes applied in CRM-6709

the old file and the newly amended file are in the changes folder.

the newly amended file has changes commented with:
// ML 2011-02-08 roll back CRM-6709

--------------------------------------------
why is this amendment not in the php folder?
--------------------------------------------

I tried to do it in the php folder, but the changes weren't being picked up.

----------------------
why the change anyway?
----------------------

CRM-6709 caused a problem in Views when applying a filter based on a multi-value custom field.

In this case, it was admin/build/views/edit/Events - the Events view in St Ethelburga's.

We want to filter by event type, but the event type is a multivalue field.
